# Supermarket Sales Prediction

## *1.Problem Statement*

The data scientists at BigMart have collected sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities for the year 2013. Now each product has certain attributes that sets it apart from other products. Same is the case with each store.

The aim is to build a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store so that it would help the decision makers at BigMart to find out the properties of any product or store, which play a key role in increasing the overall sales.

## *2. Hypothesis Generation*

It involves understanding the problem in detail by brainstorming as many factors as possible which can impact the outcome. It is done by understanding the problem statement thoroughly and before looking at the data.

We can start the process by working on four levels: Store Level, Product Level, Customer Level and Macro Level.

### 1.Store Level Hypotheses
City type: Stores located in urban or Tier 1 cities should have higher sales because of the higher income levels of people there.

Population Density: Stores located in densely populated areas should have higher sales because of more demand. Store Capacity: Stores which are very big in size should have higher sales as they act like one-stop-shops and people would prefer getting everything from one place

Competitors: Stores having similar establishments nearby should have less sales because of more competition.

Marketing: Stores which have a good marketing division should have higher sales as it will be able to attract customers through the right offers and advertising.

Location: Stores located within popular marketplaces should have higher sales because of better access to customers.

Ambiance: Stores which are well-maintained and managed by polite and humble people are expected to have higher footfall and thus higher sales.

### 2.Product Level Hypotheses
Brand: Branded products should have higher sales because of higher trust in the customer.

Packaging: Products with good packaging can attract customers and sell more.

Utility: Daily use products should have a higher tendency to sell as compared to the specific use products.

Display Area: Products which are given bigger shelves in the store are likely to catch attention first and sell more. Visibility in Store: The location of product in a store will impact sales. Ones which are right at entrance will catch the eye of customer first rather than the ones in back.

Job Profile: Customer working at executive levels would have higher chances of purchasing high amount products as compared to customers working at entry or mid senior level.

Family Size: More the number of family members, more amount will be spent by a customer to buy products

Annual Income: Higher the annual income of a customer, customer is more likely to buy high cost products. Past Purchase History: Availablity of this information can help us to determine the frequency of a product being purchased by a user.

### 4.Macro Level Hypotheses
Environment: If the environment is declared safe by government, customer would be more likely to purchase products without worrying if itâ€™s environment friendly or not.

Economic Growth: If the current economy shows a consistent growth, per capita income will rise, therefore buying power of customers will increase.
